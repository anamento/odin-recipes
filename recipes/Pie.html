    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Easy Chocolate Pie is so simple but decadent. And yet not overly sweet. You only need 5 pantry ingredients for the filling and 5 minutes of prep. The hardest part is waiting for it to be done baking!</p>
    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3></ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
        <li>Pie Shell</li>
    <ol><h3>Steps</h3></ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and cocoa powder. Vigorously whisk in the eggs, butter, and evaporated milk until completely combined and smooth (batter will be thin.)        </li>
        <li>Pour batter into the pie crust and bake for about 50-55 minutes or until the filling sets and there is a thin crust on the top. (It might be slightly jiggly in the center, but thatâ€™s okay - as it sits and cools, it will set up more.)        </li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool completely.        </li>
        <li>Slice and serve with a little whpped cream and chocolate shavings</li>
